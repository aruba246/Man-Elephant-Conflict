To meet the economical,social and health benefits humans are destroying the habitats of the wild life as a result of which these mighty creatures are heading towards human settlements away from their habitats.Being subject to lack of food and water in their habitat,the elephants tend to invade the nearby villages of the forest areas thereby leading to destruction of houses,properties and the hardwork of the farmers.The elephants eat away most of the cash producing crops,damaging the rest.This turns out to be a heavy loss to the farmers and the economic of the country as well.The invasion of elephants into human settlement has even proved out to be fatal for the people.People try and use all kinds of measures from trying to scare away these elephants with fireworks,producing loud noises,the sound of honey bees,hunting down these animals to electrocution in order to prevent elephants from creating chaos.As a result,many elephants get killed in these processes affecting the balanceof the Ecosystem.  We can build an application which on receiving the message from the sensor would send an alert message (a text message or an e-mail notification) to the concerned authorities. And,incase the situation worsens before the respective authorities take control over the situation,the application should be so created that it be able to directly call 108 and book an ambulance if needed.We can also drop pins on Google map( containing deatils about that particular elephant species as well as the time and place of intervention) so that Elephants' movements can be recorded yearwise,letting people stay aware and updated. Our goal should be to come out with a solution to this problem without causing any harm to the Elephants and thereby maintaining a peaceful coexistence between humans and these animals.
